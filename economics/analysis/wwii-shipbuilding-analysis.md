## Key Insights

### The Incredible Ramp-Up
- The ramp up in shipbuilding during WW2 was incredible. I didn't realize the U.S. was starting from such a low base
- US built just 1.4 million gross tons of merchant cargo-carrying ships from 1933 to 1939, but between 1939 and 1945 built almost 40 million gross tons

### Industrial Policy Questions
- It makes me question how much "wartime" industrial policy we need today. Do we need an internationally competitive shipbuilding industry? If we can ramp one up quickly during war why bother with the cost?
- Also astounding for the lack of impact on the ship building industry post ww2. The U.S. briefly matched the productivity of the best international shipbuilders but then lost that capability once it was no longer needed. Again what's the point if we can spin it up as needed?

### Workforce & Training
- One might think that oh ok so you don't need the industry as a foundation but maybe you need an educated workforce. Not so! I was surprised to learn that during WW2 there was no educated workforce and the industry redesigned its roles to enable uneducated workers to become productive with 2 days of training. That's incredible.

### Strategic Questions
- Why is the U.S. so bad at building ships?
- What's the strategic takeaway for today? We can do hard things when necessary? We don't need base capacity to ramp up quickly? I'm not sure.
