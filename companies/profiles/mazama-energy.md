# Mazama Energy

## Overview
Geothermal energy company developing Superhot Rock (SHR) enhanced geothermal systems for scalable, clean power generation.

## Notes
- Focus: Extracting heat from superhot rocks (>374°C/705°F) for 5-10x power output vs conventional geothermal
- Technology: MUSE™ system combining Mazama Drill, Thermal Lattice™, and Heat Harvester™
- Efficiency: Claims 80% fewer wells and 75% less water than current EGS; target <$50/MWh
- Project: 200 MW development at Newberry volcano, Oregon (DOE-supported demonstration)
- Output: Single 400°C well could generate 25MW+ (enough for 25,000 homes)
