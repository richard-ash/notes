>In pursuit of product-market fit, you should be less of a data scientist and more of an anthropologist. Every week I see teams pretending to be scientists and analyzing metrics on a test group of a few hundred users who came from odd sources unrepresentative of their broader target audience — like a Discord server or a handful of friends & acquaintances. Instead, keep it simple: Your analytics dashboard should literally just be a table of users with the following columns: 
>• Name 
>• Registration Date 
>• Last Active Time 
>• Number of Sessions 
>
>Then follow these steps: 
>1. Sort the list by Last Active Time 
>2. Look up the most active users on Instagram or Linkedin 
>3. Then interpret their behavior on your app through the lens of their online identity 
>4. If you have a messaging channel such as Intercom, send them a generic message asking for their feedback (and maybe offer a $25 gift card) Do this regularly. It's certainly not science but it will tell you more about what's resonating about the product than a bunch of statistically insignificant data.
