# Quantum Annealing

**Eli5 quantum annealing.**

Alright, let's think of a fun analogy for this!

Imagine you're trying to find the lowest point in a big, hilly park. You're blindfolded, so you can't see the hills or valleys. The only tool you have is a bouncy ball. 

1. **Traditional Computing**: It's like dropping the ball from one spot, seeing if it rolls down, and then trying again from another spot. It might take ages because you have to try so many different places.

2. **Quantum Annealing**: Now, imagine if, instead of one bouncy ball, you had a "magic ball" that could be in multiple places at once. You drop this magic ball, and it explores many hills and valleys simultaneously. Then, as time passes, you slowly reduce its magic, forcing it to choose one spot. Because it's been everywhere at once, it's more likely to end up at the lowest point in the park.

Quantum annealing uses quantum properties to explore many solutions at once and then gradually "tunes" to find the best solution. It's a technique especially useful for certain problems where you're trying to find the "lowest point" or the optimal answer among many possibilities.

**That is fun. Ok go into more detail**

Sure! Now that we have the fun analogy in mind, let's dive a bit deeper into quantum annealing:

### Basic Principle:

Quantum annealing is a technique primarily used for optimization and sampling problems. It capitalizes on quantum mechanics to find the minimum value (the "lowest point") of a complex function.

### Quantum Superposition:

The core quantum concept here is **superposition**. In classical computing, a bit is either a 0 or a 1. But a quantum bit, or **qubit**, can be in a state that's a superposition of both 0 and 1 simultaneously. It's like our "magic ball" that's in multiple places at once.

### The Annealing Process:

1. **Initialization**: At the beginning of the process, qubits are prepared in a superposition of all possible states, meaning they are exploring a vast number of potential solutions simultaneously.

2. **Evolution**: The system then evolves in such a way that it's encouraged to move toward the optimal solution. An external magnetic field is applied, causing the qubits to try and align with this field. This is like slowly reducing the magic of our ball in the analogy.

3. **Readout**: As the system slowly "anneals" or "cools down", the qubits settle into a state that represents a solution. Ideally, this would be the optimal solution or close to it, like our ball finding the lowest point.

### Quantum Tunneling:

Another crucial concept is **quantum tunneling**, which allows qubits to "tunnel" through energy barriers instead of being forced to go over them. Think of it as our "magic ball" being able to pass through a hill instead of being stopped or deflected by it. This makes finding the lowest point more efficient because it can explore areas that might be difficult or slow to reach classically.

### Applications:

Quantum annealing is mainly used for optimization problems that are tough for classical computers. This includes tasks like:

- Traveling salesman problem (finding the shortest possible route that visits several cities and returns to the origin city).
- Machine learning tasks, like training neural networks.
- Financial modeling and portfolio optimization.

### Hardware:

D-Wave Systems is a company that has commercialized quantum annealing machines. While there's debate about the extent to which these devices provide a quantum advantage over classical computers, they represent a fascinating approach to harnessing quantum mechanics for computation.

### Limitations:

Quantum annealing is a specialized technique and doesn't apply to all problems. It's specifically designed for optimization and isn't a general-purpose quantum computing technique like gate-based quantum computing.

In conclusion, quantum annealing offers a promising approach to solving certain hard problems by exploiting the principles of quantum mechanics. The field is still in its infancy, and as technology progresses, the potential advantages of quantum annealing might become more evident.
