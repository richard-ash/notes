# Many-worlds interpretation

## Double Slit Experiment Exmaple

Can you explain to me the many worlds explanation of double slit experiment?

Sure! Imagine you have a toy gun that shoots little balls, and in front of you, there's a big wall with two small slits or openings. If you shoot the balls at the wall, you'd expect them to go through the slits and make two neat piles behind each slit, right?

But when scientists do this with tiny things like electrons (which are much smaller than balls), something strange happens. Instead of two neat piles, they see a pattern of many lines, like waves in a pond, on the wall behind the slits. This is weird because electrons are not supposed to act like waves; they are like tiny balls.

So, how do we explain this? One idea is the "Many Worlds" explanation. It's a bit like saying every time you make a choice, a new universe is created for each option. In the double-slit experiment, it's as if each electron can go through both slits at the same time, each in a different universe. When these universes come together, they make the wave-like pattern.

This is a very strange idea, and even scientists find it hard to imagine. It's like saying there are many, many invisible worlds where all the choices we didn't make are happening. In the double-slit experiment, these many worlds explain why we see a wave pattern instead of just two piles.

Remember, this is just one way to think about it. Scientists have many ideas to explain this strange behavior, and the Many Worlds explanation is just one of them. It's like a story to help us understand something very, very puzzling!
