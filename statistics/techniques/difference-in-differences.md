## What is it?

Alright, let's use a simple example to explain difference-in-differences (DiD) design:

Imagine you're a school principal and you've just introduced a new teaching method in one of your two identical 5th-grade classes to see if it improves students' math scores. The other class continues with the usual method. At the end of the year, you want to see if your new method made a difference.

**Steps in Difference-in-Differences Design:**

1. **Before the Change**: At the start of the year, you record the average math score of both classes. Let's say both classes have an average score of 70%.

2. **After the Change**: At the end of the year, the class with the new method has an average score of 80%, while the other class has an average score of 75%.

3. **Calculate the Differences**:
    - The class with the new method improved by 10% (from 70% to 80%).
    - The class with the old method improved by 5% (from 70% to 75%).

4. **Find the "Difference-in-Differences"**: Subtract the improvement of the old method class (5%) from the improvement of the new method class (10%). This gives you a 5% difference-in-differences.

So, thanks to the DiD design, you can conclude that the new teaching method improved scores by an extra 5% compared to the usual method.

In essence, DiD allows you to account for other factors that might have caused scores to improve in both classes (like students just naturally getting better at math over the year) and isolate the impact of your new teaching method.
